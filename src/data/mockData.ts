It calms overactive nerve signals in the brain and reduces abnormal electrical activity, leading to fewer seizures and less anxiety or panic.\n\nRivotril 2mg Tablet should be taken exactly as your doctor prescribes. The dose may be adjusted slowly to find the amount that works best for you. Take it at the same time each day to maintain steady levels in the body. Do not stop taking the medicine suddenly. Stopping abruptly can lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, mood changes, agitation, and unusual sensations. If treatment needs to be stopped, your doctor will guide you through a gradual dose reduction.\n\nThe medicine can cause dependence when used for long periods, and misuse or taking higher doses than prescribed can lead to serious harm. To get the most benefit, keep all follow-up appointments, inform your doctor about any other medicines you take, and immediately report worsening seizures, new mood changes, or unusual behavior.\n\nThe most common side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, poor coordination or unsteady movements, problems with concentration or memory, and low mood. These effects usually appear when treatment is started, or doses are increased, and may lessen over time as the body adjusts. If any side effect becomes troublesome or severe, consult your doctor promptly.\n\nRivotril 2mg Tablet can impair thinking, judgment, and physical coordination. Activities like driving, operating machinery, or handling animals that require quick responses should be avoided until you know how the medicine affects you. Alcohol and other sedatives can dangerously increase drowsiness, breathing problems, or risk of overdose and should not be used with this medicine.\n\nPeople with liver disease, severe lung problems, or acute narrow-angle glaucoma should avoid using it. Individuals with depression or a history of mood disorders should be monitored closely because antiepileptic drugs, including Rivotril 2mg Tablet, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding, speak with your doctor, as the medicine can affect newborns and pass into breast milk."

It can also be used to treat acute alcohol withdrawal, to relieve muscle spasm and as adjunctive therapy for seizures. This medicine relaxes the nerve cells and calms the brain.\n\nValium 10mg Tablet may be taken with or without food. However, take it at the same time each day as this helps to maintain a consistent level of medicine in the body. Take this medicine in the dose and duration as advised by your doctor as it has a high potential of habit-forming. If you have missed any doses, take it as soon as you remember it and finish the full course of treatment even if you feel better. Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly without talking to your doctor as it can cause withdrawal effects like depression and difficulty sleeping.\n\nThe most common side effects of this medicine include drowsiness, fatigue, muscle weakness, and impaired coordination. If any of these side effects do not subside on their own or get worse, let your doctor know. Also, do not drive or do anything that requires mental focus until you know how this medicine affects you.\n\nThis medicine may cause weight gain. But, a well balanced diet and regular exercise can help to reduce extra weight. If you have been taking this medicine for a long time then regular monitoring of blood and liver functions may be required."

                "description": "In Epilepsy\nValium 10mg Tablet slows down electrical signals in the brain which cause seizures (fits). It can also help reduce symptoms such as confusion, uncontrollable jerking movements, loss of awareness, and fear or anxiety. The medicine can allow you to do some activities that you would otherwise be forbidden or scared to do (such as swimming and driving). It can take a few weeks for this medicine to work (because the dose has to be increased slowly) and during this time you may still have seizures.\n\nIn Short term anxiety\nValium 10mg Tablet reduces the symptoms of excessive anxiety and worry that are triggered only at the time of stressful conditions that last for a shorter duration. These could be job interviews, exams, stage performances, etc. It can effectively manage feelings of restlessness, tiredness, difficulty concentrating and feeling irritable. Valium 10mg Tablet will therefore help you go about your daily activities more easily and be more productive. Keep taking this medicine even if you feel well. Stopping suddenly can cause serious problems.\n\nIn Alcohol withdrawal\nValium 10mg Tablet is a medicine used, along with social support and counseling, to help people recover from alcohol addiction and to avoid having the urge to drink alcohol again. Valium 10mg Tablet starts working from the very first dose and is a very safe and effective way of treating alcohol addiction.\n\nIn Muscle spasm\nValium 10mg Tablet effectively relieves muscle stiffness or spasm, thereby improving muscle movement. Take it as prescribed by the doctor to get the most benefit. Do not take more or for longer than needed as that can be dangerous and it also has habit-forming potential. In general, you should take the lowest dose that works, for the shortest possible time. This will help you go about your daily activities more easily and have a better, more active, quality of life."

MISUSE OF THIS MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription. Keep this medicine where others cannot get to it. Do not take more tramadol than prescribed as an overdosage can be fatal. Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law.\n\nA person caring for you should give naloxone and seek emergency medical attention if you have slow breathing with long pauses, blue-colored lips, or if you find it hard to wake up. Serious breathing problems may be more likely in older adults and people who are debilitated or have wasting syndrome or chronic breathing disorders.\nCall your doctor at once if you have:\nnoisy breathing, sighing, shallow breathing, breathing that stops during sleep;\na slow heart rate or weak pulse;\na light-headed feeling, like you might pass out;\nseizure (convulsions); or\nlow cortisol levels - nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, dizziness, worsening tiredness or weakness.\nSeek medical attention right away if you have symptoms of serotonin syndrome, such as agitation, hallucinations, fever, sweating, shivering, fast heart rate, muscle stiffness, twitching, loss of coordination, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n\nSeizures have been reported in patients taking tramadol. Your risk of seizures is higher if you are taking higher doses than recommended. Seizure risk is also higher in those with a seizure disorder or those taking certain antidepressants or opioid medications.\n\nYou should not take tramadol if you have severe breathing problems, a head injury or increased pressure inside your skull, a blockage in your stomach or intestines, or if you have recently used alcohol, sedatives, tranquilizers, narcotic medication, or an MAO inhibitor (isocarboxazid, linezolid, methylene blue injection, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, tranylcypromine, and others). Tramadol should not be used if you are suicidal or prone to addiction.\n\nFatal side effects can occur if you use this medicine with alcohol, or with other drugs that cause drowsiness or slow your breathing. People taking extended-release forms of tramadol should not consume alcohol-containing beverages at the same time. Alcohol is also not advised with immediate-release forms of tramadol.\n\nSerious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred with tramadol, some of which caused death. People who are allergic to other opioids are at higher risk. Other hypersensitivity reactions include itching, hives, narrowing of the airways, swelling of the face and airways (angioedema), and serious skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to tramadol (symptoms include hives, difficulty breathing, swelling in your face or throat) or a severe skin reaction (fever, sore throat, burning in your eyes, skin pain, a red or purple skin rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling).\n\nTramadol hydrochloride extended-release capsules/tablets may complicate a healthcare provider's clinical assessment of an acute abdominal condition. They should be used by people with liver or kidney disease.\n\nTaking tramadol during pregnancy may cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the newborn.\n\nTramadol should not be given to a child younger than 12 years old, or anyone younger than 18 years old who recently had surgery to remove the tonsils or adenoids. Extended-release tramadol (Ultram ER) should not be given to anyone younger than 18 years.\n\nTramadol may cause drowsiness or affect your ability to drive or perform hazardous tasks.

                "description": "WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS); LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL' SYNDROME; CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS\n\nAddiction, Abuse, and Misuse\nROXICODONE expose patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient’s risk prior to prescribing ROXICODONE, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions.\n\nOpioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)\nTo ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a REMS for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to • complete a REMS-compliant education program, • counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products, • emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacist, and • consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety.\n\nLife-Threatening Respiratory Depression\nSerious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of ROXICODONE. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of ROXICODONE or following a dose increase.\n\nAccidental Ingestion\nAccidental ingestion of ROXICODONE, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of ROXICODONE.\n\nNeonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome\nProlonged use of ROXICODONE during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.\n\nCytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction\nThe concomitant use of ROXICODONE with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving ROXICODONE and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer.\n\nRisks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants\nConcomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.\nReserve concomitant prescribing of ROXICODONE and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.\nLimit dosages and durations to the minimum required.\nFollow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation."
